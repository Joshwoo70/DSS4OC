### FAQ
- Q: Holy s**t! How does it work?
- A: DFPWM is a mono codec... however...  
`stereo can be achieved by running two streams in parallel`  
 I split all the tracks (5 tracks in total) into individual mono tracks and then encoded in DFPWM.  
 This is then fed to OC and a 5.1 Surround Sound set up with speakers and tape drives.
 
### Setup  
It's quite simple. Here's a Picture:

The colour corresponds to these drives:
